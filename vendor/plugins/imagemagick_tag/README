ImageMagick-Tag

This plugin provides an easy way to use ImageMagick commands to process
images from a Rails template.

The basic idea is this: you have a directory with images, and want to
process them with ImageMagick (because you want to resize them, or crop
them, or rotate them etc.). Suppose that you have an image gallery, with a
controller Photo to display the images. The image files are stored in the
directory '/var/lib/photos'. Now, if you want to generate and display
thumbnails, you'd do this:

# in the controller
class Photo < ApplicationController
  imagemagick_for '/var/lib/photos'
end

# in the view
<%= imagemagick_tag 'first_photo.jpg', 'resize(100x100)' %>

Request the view, and ta-da: the image first_photo.jpg is displayed, and it
is resized to fit within 100x100 pixels. You can use many other ImageMagick
commands in the same way.
